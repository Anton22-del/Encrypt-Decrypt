# Encode and Decode Files

DO NOT USE FOR IMPORTANT TEXT. I do not understand encryption, this project is only for implementing and testing python dependencies. This code encodes and decodes text. To use, download the repository, extract, and run the .exe file inside the dist folder. To encode follow the prompts and REMEMBER THE KEY. To decode, run decode.exe and follow the prompts. 

If you have Python installed, you can also just copy the scripts in the Python Files folder.
